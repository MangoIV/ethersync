# Next release

- Documentation moved to an mdBook at <https://ethersync.github.io/ethersync/>.

New features:

- #127

Bug fixes:

- #152

# 0.3.0 (2024-08-13)

New features:

- Integrated libp2p for transport encryption and authentication of peers.
- Added a password protection â€“ peers must specify the same `--secret` to connect.
- You can now provide default startup arguments in `.ethersync/config`.

Bug fixes:

- The daemon is now more resilient against misbehaving peers and editors, and won't crash as easily.

# 0.2.2 (2024-08-01)

New features:

- Persist the CRDT to `.ethersync/doc`, so that peers can run independently, and sync back later.
- When restarting the daemon, calculate file diffs since the daemon was last online, and apply them to the CRDT.
- Dynamically create files when they are opened.
- When files are deleted, delete them for all peers.
- Sandbox file I/O to be restricted into the shared project folder.
- The editor plugin can now send JSON-RPC requests and get feedback on whether the intended operation worked or not.

# 0.2.1 (2024-07-26)

New features:

- Share multiple files per directory.
- Transmit cursor positions, and display them in the Neovim plugin.
- Add a Nix flake to the project for simplified installation.
- The "cursor" messages in the editor protocol are no longer revisioned. In practice, this seems to work well enough.

# 0.2.0 (2024-05-02)

Rewrite of the initial prototype in Rust.

# 0.1.0 (2024-01-22)

An initial prototype in Typescript. It only supports sharing a single file.
