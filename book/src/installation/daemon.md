# ðŸ˜ˆ Daemon

Every participant needs a **daemon**, that runs on their local machine, and connects to other peers.
You might be able to use one of the following packages, or you could try a manual installation.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the Nix package on any Linux or MacOS system!

  Install the [ethersync-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ethersync-git) package from the AUR.

  This repository provides a Nix flake. You can put it in your PATH like this:

  ```bash
  nix shell github:ethersync/ethersync
  ```

  If you want to install it permanently, you probably know what your favorite approach is.

  <summary>Manual installation</summary>
  <br>

  You will need a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installation. You can then compile the daemon like this:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:ethersync/ethersync
  cd ethersync/daemon
  cargo build --release
  ```

  This should download all dependencies, and successfully compile the project.

  For the next steps to succeed you need to make sure that the resulting `ethersync` binary is in your shell PATH.
  One option to do this temporarily is to run this command in the terminal:

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
  ```
</details>

To confirm that the installation worked, try running:

```bash
ethersync
```

This should show the available options.
