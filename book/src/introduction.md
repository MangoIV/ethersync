# Introduction

Have you used software like Google Docs, Etherpad or Hedgedoc? It's a very direct way to collaborate â€“ multiple people can type into a document at the same time, and you can see each other's cursors.

Ethersync enables a workflow like that, but for **local text files, using your favorite text editors** like Neovim or VS Code!

This documentation describes how to install and use Ethersync, explains how it works, and how to write new text editor plugins for it.

Note that Ethersync is still very much in development. At this point in time it is usable (we use it every day!) but has a lot of subtle things to know about and things that you might expect to work that do not yet work.
Consider it as a proof of concept that can be used "in production". Of course make sure to have backups.
A main reason we have written a lot of documentation is to give you the ability to learn about this system and with that allow you to use it smoothly despite the caveats.
