# Installation

Every user of Ethersync needs to install two components:

- The **Ethersync daemon** runs on your local machine, and is responsible for synchronization with other peers.
- A **plugin for your preferred text editor** â€“ currently, we offer a Neovim plugin. The plugin will connect to the daemon, send it what you type, and receive other peoples' changes.
